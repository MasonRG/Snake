## Details

This project was created in order to gain experience with C++ programming and to learn how to use the Entity Component System aspect of the EnTT library. The project was created for educational purposes, and so the code and structure might leave a bit to be desired. Being new to C++, I hope I didn't break too many conventions or do anything too unusual.

In any case, I hope this project might serve as a useful resource to others who are perhaps new to c++ and entt, as I was when creating it.

### External Libraries

##### SDL2
The [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) is used for rendering as well as input and event handling.

##### SDL2_image
The [SDL2 Image library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) is used for reading image files such as jpg or png.

##### SDL2_ttf
The [SDL2 TTF library](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/index.html) is used for reading .ttf files and generating textures from text.

##### EnTT
The [EnTT library](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) provides an Enitity Component System (ECS) that is the primary driver of gameplay and is the focus of the project.
